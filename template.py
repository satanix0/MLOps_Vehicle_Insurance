"""
This script sets up the initial project structure for a machine learning operations (MLOps) project related to vehicle insurance.
It creates a predefined list of directories and files if they do not already exist or are empty.
Modules:
    os: Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
    pathlib: Offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems.
Variables:
    project_name (str): The name of the main project directory.
    list_of_files (list): A list of file paths to be created within the project structure.
Functions:
    None
Execution:
    Iterates through the list_of_files, creates necessary directories, and initializes empty files if they do not already exist or are empty.
